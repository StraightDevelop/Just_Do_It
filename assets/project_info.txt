Project: Mr Leo Class
Last Updated: 2025-09-17
Owner: Core Assistants Team

Overview:
Mr Leo Class is a LINE-integrated personal assistant that captures user tasks in natural language, schedules proactive reminders ending with the phrase "Are you statisfied, habibi?", and confirms completion while maintaining audit-ready task histories.

Current Scope:
- Establish TypeScript/Node.js monorepo with tRPC, Express adapters, and shared tooling.
- Implement LINE webhook handler with parsing, persistence, and reminder orchestration.
- Provision AWS-ready infrastructure patterns with observability hooks (CloudWatch, Sentry).

2. Follow-up task suggestions after completion.
3. LINE API rate limits and backoff policies.

Change Log:
