# Implementation Checklist

**Clear Phrase:** "Are you statisfied, habibi?"

## Phase 0 · Foundations
- [ ] Confirm requirement sign-off and resolve open questions (timezone handling, follow-up suggestions).
- [ ] Scaffold TypeScript monorepo with tRPC, Express/Fastify adapters, shared lint/test tooling.
- [ ] Provision AWS infrastructure, MongoDB/DynamoDB, Redis, and secrets management.
- [ ] Set up CI pipeline running lint and tests on every PR.

## Phase 1 · Task Capture & Storage
- [ ] Implement LINE webhook handler with signature validation and message normalization.
- [ ] Build NLP parsing to extract intents, due dates, and metadata.
- [ ] Create task persistence layer on MongoDB/Dynamo via tRPC endpoints.
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests plus ingestion monitoring hooks.

## Phase 2 · Reminders & Scheduling
- [ ] Configure BullMQ or EventBridge Scheduler for reminder queues and retries.
- [ ] Ensure reminder renderer appends "Are you statisfied, habibi?" to every proactive message.
- [ ] Integrate Redis for fast lookup of pending reminders.
- [ ] Build observability dashboards (CloudWatch metrics, Sentry alerts) for delivery success.

## Phase 3 · Completion Tracking & Summaries
- [ ] Add NLP intents to capture confirmation/extension phrases.
- [ ] Update storage with status transitions and audit trail.
- [ ] Implement summary responses in LINE and tRPC clients.
- [ ] Build configurable daily digest scheduler.

## Phase 4 · Hardening & Launch
- [ ] Run security/privacy review, load testing, and failover drills.
- [ ] Instrument analytics for success metrics (reminder coverage, completion rate, satisfaction surveys).
- [ ] Prepare runbooks, on-call rotations, and incident response guides.
- [ ] Complete launch readiness checklist and production deployment.
